| |  |  | | --- | --- | | CWE Glossary Definition |  | |  | |        CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data  |  | | --- | | Weakness ID: 502   Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWED This CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities   Abstraction: Base Base - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. |  View customized information:  For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers.  For users who are concerned with the practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts.  For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers.  For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry.  For users who want to customize what details are displayed.  ×  Edit Custom Filter  Description  |  |  | | --- | --- | | The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid. |  |  Alternate Terms  |  |  | | --- | --- | | Marshaling, Unmarshaling | Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively. | | Pickling, Unpickling | In Python, the "pickle" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization. | | PHP Object Injection | Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915. |  Common Consequences  This table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited to achieve a different impact.  | Impact | Details | | --- | --- | | *Modify Application Data; Unexpected State* | Scope: Integrity   Attackers can modify unexpected objects or data that was assumed to be safe from modification. Deserialized data or code could be modified without using the provided accessor functions, or unexpected functions could be invoked. | | *DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)* | Scope: Availability   If a function is making an assumption on when to terminate, based on a sentry in a string, it could easily never terminate. | | *Varies by Context* | Scope: Other   The consequences can vary widely, because it depends on which objects or methods are being deserialized, and how they are used. Making an assumption that the code in the deserialized object is valid is dangerous and can enable exploitation. One example is attackers using gadget chains to perform unauthorized actions, such as generating a shell. |  Potential Mitigations  | Phase(s) | Mitigation | | --- | --- | | Architecture and Design; Implementation | If available, use the signing/sealing features of the programming language to assure that deserialized data has not been tainted. For example, a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) could be used to ensure that data has not been modified. | | Implementation | When deserializing data, populate a new object rather than just deserializing. The result is that the data flows through safe input validation and that the functions are safe. | | Implementation | Explicitly define a final object() to prevent deserialization. | | Architecture and Design; Implementation | Make fields transient to protect them from deserialization.  An attempt to serialize and then deserialize a class containing transient fields will result in NULLs where the transient data should be. This is an excellent way to prevent time, environment-based, or sensitive variables from being carried over and used improperly. | | Implementation | Avoid having unnecessary types or gadgets (a sequence of instances and method invocations that can self-execute during the deserialization process, often found in libraries) available that can be leveraged for malicious ends. This limits the potential for unintended or unauthorized types and gadgets to be leveraged by the attacker. Add only acceptable classes to an allowlist. Note: new gadgets are constantly being discovered, so this alone is not a sufficient mitigation. | | Architecture and Design; Implementation | Employ cryptography of the data or code for protection. However, it's important to note that it would still be client-side security. This is risky because if the client is compromised then the security implemented on the client (the cryptography) can be bypassed. | | Operation | Strategy: *Firewall*  Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth [REF-1481].  Effectiveness: Moderate  **Note:**  An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization. |  Relationships  This table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction.

Detection
Methods

| Method | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Automated Static Analysis | Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)  Effectiveness: High |

Vulnerability Mapping Notes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Usage | **ALLOWED**  (this CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities) |
| Reason | Acceptable-Use |
| Rationale | This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. |
| Comments | Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction. |

Notes

Maintenance

The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.
